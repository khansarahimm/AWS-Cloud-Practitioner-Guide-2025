## Recommendations

* **Hands-On Practice:** Use AWS Free Tier to explore services like EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, and DynamoDB
* **Active Learning:** Summarize concepts in your own words, make flashcards, and revisit weak areas
* **Simulate Exam Conditions:** Time yourself and minimize distractions for practice exams
* **Scenario Understanding:** Focus on real-world applications of AWS services, not just memorization

---

## About This Approach

This repository is designed to give learners a **structured, self-paced path**:

* Foundational knowledge first (`01-Foundations/`)
* Incremental practice with questions (`dumps/`)
* Exam simulation (`practice-exams/`)
* Progress tracking (`prep-tracker.md`)

> My philosophy: Researching explanations for answers improves conceptual understanding. Memorization alone is not enough for long-term retention.

## Additional Tips

* If you are in **Lahore**, onsite exams are available at Pearson VUE centers:

  * Recommended: **JNS Testing Center, MM Alam Road, Gulberg 2**
  * **KICS, UET Lahore (Center for Innovation and Creative Services)** is another excellent option
* **Online Proctored Exam:** Ensure a quiet environment, stable internet, and a webcam-equipped device
* **Accommodations:** AWS allows requests for extra time or English as a second language; submit requests via the certification portal
