## 4. Onsite Exam in Lahore (Optional)

For candidates in **Lahore** who prefer to take the exam in-person:

- You can book your exam at any **Pearson VUE authorized test center**.  
- If you want a recommended center, I personally visited:  
  - **JNS Testing Center, MM Alam Road, Gulberg 2, Lahore** – Professional setup, quiet environment, supportive staff  
- My experience: It was difficult to find reliable reviews online, but this center is well-maintained and provides a smooth exam experience  

> Tip: Any Pearson VUE authorized center will meet AWS standards. Consider proximity, environment, and availability when choosing.
